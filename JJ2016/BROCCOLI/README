==========================================

This directory contains a MAT-file containing the three quadrature filters for 
the linear registration by the JJ2016 algorithm. The quadrature filters are a 
part of BROCCOLI, a software for analysis of fMRI data, developed by Anders 
Eklund,Paul Dufort, Mattias Villani and Stephen Laconte. The software is 
licensed under GPL version 3.
